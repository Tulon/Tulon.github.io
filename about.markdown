My name is Joseph Artsimovich. I learned C back in High School, around 1996 I think. I've been working as a software engineer since 2002, mostly with C++. I have nothing against other languages, although I do prefer the compiled ones.

Currently, I am based in Lithuania (EU, GMT+2). As my next career move, I'd like to become an independent contractor.

I've been working remotely since 2018 (back before the pandemic), and I am determined to keep it that way.

Interested parties, please take a look at my [CV](/assets/CV_Joseph_Artsimovich.pdf) and write me an

    );
</script>.
